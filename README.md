# LychrelSieve
Program to find Lychrel Candidates (within N iterations)
# Scope
I plan to write this algorithm in both Rust and Java for the purpose of comparision between the two. I plan to attempt multi-threading across both langs, and later merge the Rust code into a JNI lib to test JNI overhead.
